That is, a regression model with only one independent variable $X$ on the right hand side.^[With right hand side we mean on the right side of the equal sign $=$. It is often abbreviated with RHS.] However, and especially in the social sciences, you almost always see regressions with many independent variables. Depending on the field, these variables can be called control variables, confounding factors, mediator or moderator variables.^[There is something more to the use of these names of variables and their exact working but we leave that for another course.] But why are these variables included? Is it only to improve model performance or are there other reasons? @sec-morevar deals with this question whereafter @sec-multivariate shows how you can include additional variables in a *multivariate regression model* and especially how you should interpret them. @sec-nonlinear extends the multivariate regression model and shows how you can actually use this model to estimate a broad range of linear and non-linear economic models. @sec-fixedeffects discusses the use of multiple dummy variables (see again @sec-dummy) in a way that economists refer to as *fixed effects*. The last section concludes and provides a further discussion of the benefits and limitations of multivariate regression models. \n\n## Why more independent variables? {#sec-morevar}\n\nSo, why do we include more variables? One possible answer is because it makes a better predictive model. That is, a model that is able to explain the variation in the dependent variable $Y$ better.^[This is not entirely true. Increasing the R$^2$ explains **in-sample** variation better, not necessarily **out-of-sample**. The latter is really what matters for prediction and this is the focus of many machine learning techniques. Note that this argument is directly related with the regression towards the mean argument made in @sec-genesis.] So, the R$^2$ increases. But, as argued in @sec-univariateregression we are not so much interested in prediction, but more in establishing a **causal** relation between $X$ and $Y$. So, if you change $X$ (and only $X$) does $Y$ change and then with how much?\n\nAlthough economists often claim that they are the only (social-)science that focuses on causality and provides a statistical framework for that, there are other approaches to causality as well. One that is often used in other sciences is the approach of the mathematican Judea Pearl [@pearl2009causality]. This approach focuses on the use of Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs), which is a graphical visualisation of causality chains (or, what impacts what). We borrow this approach for the most simple setting as explained in @fig-unknown. Here, we go back to our Californian school district dataset again, where we still are interested in the effect of class size on school performance. So, we suppose that there is an effect from student teacher ratio on test scores as displayed with an directed arrow in @fig-unknown. We also know that the R$^2$ of that regression model was rather low (5%), so by default there must be other but yet unknown factors, let us name them for now $U$ (often as well referred to as unobservables), that influence test scores as well (so a directed arrow going from $U$ to test scores). \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Unrelated omitted variables](./figures/unknown.png){#fig-unknown fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow we are fine with this is as long as $U$ does **not impact** the student teacher ratio. Then, there is still an isolated effect of student teacher ratio on class size and that is exactly what we want to measure. However, if there is a directed arrow going from $U$ into $STR$ as depicted by @fig-unobshet, then the effect of student teacher ratio is not isolated anymore. Essentially, the effect of student teacher ratio on class size is composed out of two parts:\n\n1) The **causal** effect on student teacher ratio on class size captured by the chain $\\text{STR} \\longrightarrow \\text{testscore}$. The one we are after.\n2) The impact of the unknown variables on test scores. As we have not modeled them in our regression model, the effect is captured by the chain $U \\longrightarrow \\text{STR} \\longrightarrow \\text{testscore}$\n\nEconomists refer to this phenomenon as **omitted variable bias**, whilst in the statistical world, this is as often called confounding variables or the  **confounding fork** [@mcelreath2020statistical] and it, unfortunately, occurs very often.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Related omitted variables](./figures/Unobshet.png){#fig-unobshet fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, when **U** is a *common* cause for both student teacher ratio and test scores there is omitted variable bias. If we go back to our population regression model as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + u_i,\n\\end{equation}\nthen we know that the error $u$ arises because of factors that influence $Y$ but are not included in the regression function; so, there are *always* omitted variables. But they do not always lead to bias. For omitted variable bias to occur, the omitted factor, let's call it $Z$^[$Z$ can be both known or unknown, so that is why we change from $U$ to $Z$], must be:\n\n1. A **determinant** of $Y$ (i.e. $Z$ is part of $u$)\n2. A **determinant** of the regressor $X$ (*at least*, there should hold that $corr(Z,X) \\neq 0$)^[In econometric textbooks, as, e.g, in @stock2003introduction, this condition is weakened to only being correlation ($Z$ and $X$ are correlated). However, if the directed arrow goes from $STR$ into $U$ in @fig-unobshet then that would lead to something else than omitted variables, namely to a difference between a direct ($\\text{STR} \\longrightarrow \\text{testscore}$) and an indirect effect ($\\text{STR} \\longrightarrow U \\longrightarrow \\text{testscore}$).]\n\nThus, both conditions must hold for the omission of $Z$ to result in omitted variable bias.\n\nNow, in our Californian district school dataset we have many more variables. One of them is a variable that measures the english language ability (whether the student has English as a second language). Note that in California there are many migrants, especially from Latin-America. Now, you can readily argue that not having English as first language plausibly affects standardized test scores: so, $Z$ is a **determinant** of $Y$. Moreover, immigrant communities tend to be less affluent and thus have smaller school budgets---and, therefore, higher $STR$: $Z$ is most likely as well a **determinant** of $X$.\n\nSo, most likely, our original estimation from @sec-univariateregression, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, is biased (so, it is not the true causal effect). But can we say something about the direction of that bias? Yes, but the argument tends to become very quickly rather complex. In this case, note that districts with more migrant communities tend to have (*i*) higher class sizes and (*ii*) lower test scores. So, to the original estimation they add a *negative* effect. Thus, following this reasoning, the \"true\" effect must be less negative. Now, especially with negative signs this reasoning becomes rather complex, so if common sense fails you, then there is the following formula:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\overset{p}{\\to} \\beta_1 + \\frac{\\sigma_u}{\\sigma_X}\\rho_{Xu},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere you should focus on the sign of the correlation between $X$ and the regression residual $u$ (all standard errors, $\\sigma$, are always positive by default). Now, the first least squares assumption states that $\\rho_{Xu} = 0$---no correlation between the regressor and the regression residual. But now there is correlation because of omitted variable bias. And because there is a negative relation between immigrants communities and school performance, $\\rho_{Xu}$ should be negative. Furthermore, because the original estimation from @sec-univariateregression was already negative to begin with the \"true\" $\\beta_1$ should be less negative. In conclusion, districts with more English learning students (*i*) do worse on standardized tests and (*ii*) have bigger classes (smaller budgets), so ignoring the English learning factor results in overstating the class size effect (in an absolute sense).\n\nYou might wonder whether this is actually going on in the Californian district school data. To see this, @fig-omitca offers a cross tabulation of test scores by class size and percentage English learners. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Cross tabulation of test scores by class size and percentage English learners](./figures/Sheet7.png){#fig-omitca fig-align='center' width=800px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, the table depicted in @fig-omitca is complex in its various dimensions. We have our two categories of class size (small and large), together with the difference in test scores, but we now stratify this by four categories of percentage English learners---that is, the percentage of pupils for whom English is *not* the native language. There are several important observations to make here:\n\n1) districts with *fewer* English Learners (so less migrants) have on average *higher* test scores (what we assumed above);\n2) districts with *fewer* English Learners (so less migrants) have *smaller* classes (what we assumed above);\n3) the effect of class size with comparable percentages English learners is still (mostly negative), but not as much as we compare for all districts together (the *Difference*-column). This confirms our reasoning that our original estimate was too negative. \n\nNo, as already mentioned above, omitted variable bias occurs very often. So, how to correct for this such that the bias disappaers. In general, there are three strategies:\n\n1. we can run a randomized controlled experiment in which treatment ($STR$) is randomly assigned: then percentage English learners ($PctEL$) is still a determinant of test scores, but by construction $PctEL$ should be uncorrelated with $STR$. Unfortunately, is it very difficult to randomize class size in reality  and often this strategy is just not attainable as being too costly or unethical (this argument accounts by the way for all sciences, not only the social sciences);\n2. we can adopt the cross tabulation approach of above, with finer gradations of $STR$ and $PctEL$. Then by construction, within each group all classes have the same $PctEL$ so we control for $PctEL$. A disadvantages is that one needs many observations, especially when one wants to stratify upon other variables as well; \n3. finally, and perhaps the easiest approach, we can use a population regression model in which the omitted variable ($PctEL$) is no longer omitted. We just include $PctEL$ as an additional regressor in a multiple regression model. This is what the next section deals with. Obviously, a disadvantage of this approach is that you need observations for the omitted variable (but that also accounts for method 2). \n\n## Multivariate regression analysis {#sec-multivariate}\n\nSo, if we have information about an important omitted variable, as in the case of the size of migrant communities in the example above, then we can use that information in a multivariate population regression model. In the case of two regressors, that would look like:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i =\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + \\beta_2 X_{2i} + u_i, i=1,\\ldots,n\n\\end{equation}\nwhere:\n\n- $Y$ is the dependent variable\n- $X_1$, $X_2$ are the two independent variables (regressors)\n- $(Y_i, X_{1i}, X_{2i})$ denote the i$^{\\mathrm{th}}$ observation on $Y$, $X_1$, and $X_2$.\n- $\\beta_0$ is the  unknown population intercept\n- $\\beta_1$ is the effect on $Y$ of a change in $X_1$, **holding** $X_2$ constant\n- $\\beta_2$ is the effect on $Y$ of a change in $X_2$, **holding** $X_1$ constant\n- $u_i$ is the the regression error (omitted factors)\n\nNow, the only element that changes is the interpretation of a parameter, say $\\beta_1$. In this case, it can still be seen as a 'slope' parameter, although now in 3-dimensional space, but it also states specifically that the other parameter(s) should be **held constant**. This does facilitate the interpretation of $\\beta_1$. For example, consider changing $X_1$ by $\\Delta X_1$ while holding $X_2$ constant. That means that the population regression line before the change looks like:\n\\begin{equation}\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1} + \\beta_2 X_{2},\n\\end{equation}\nwhilst the population regression line, after the change, looks like:\n\\begin{equation}\nY + \\Delta Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (X_{1} + \\Delta X_1) + \\beta_2 X_{2}\n\\end{equation}\nAnd if we take the difference, then the interpretation of $\\beta_1$ boils down again to the marginal effect:$\\Delta Y = \\beta_1 \\Delta X_1$. Or, $\\beta_1 = \\frac{\\Delta Y}{\\Delta X_1}$ when holding $X_2$ constant and, likewise, $\\beta_2 = \\frac{\\Delta Y}{\\Delta X_2}$ when holding $X_1$ constant. $\\beta_0$ is now the predicted value of $Y$ when $X_1 = X_2 = 0$\n\nIf we do this for the the Californian school district data, then the original population regression line was estimated as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{TestScore} = 698.9- 2.28 STR\n\\end{equation}\nBut if we now include include percent English Learners in the district ($PctEL$) to the model then the population regression 'line' becomes:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{TestScore} = 686.0- 1.10 STR - 0.65  PctEL\n\\end{equation}\n\nClearly, the effect of student teacher ratio becomes smaller (that is, less negative). That indicates that the original regression suffers from omitted variable bias. And this is what should happen as reasoned above. The `STATA` syntax for a multivariate regression model is now rather straightforward. You basically add another to the regression equation, as below (do not forget the command `, robust`):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nset linesize 96\nreg testscr str el_pct, robust\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear regression                               Number of obs     =        420\n                                                F(2, 417)         =     223.82\n                                                Prob > F          =     0.0000\n                                                R-squared         =     0.4264\n                                                Root MSE          =     14.464\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             |               Robust\n     testscr | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n         str |  -1.101296   .4328472    -2.54   0.011     -1.95213   -.2504616\n      el_pct |  -.6497768   .0310318   -20.94   0.000     -.710775   -.5887786\n       _cons |   686.0322   8.728224    78.60   0.000     668.8754     703.189\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nObviously, the effect of student teacher ration reduces with 50%! The interpretation of the rest of the statistical output, such as measures of fit and test statistics, follows in the subsections below.\n\n### Measures of fit for multiple regression\n\nIn multivariate regression models, there are four commonly used measures of fit, three of them we have seen before. \n\n1. The standard error of regression or the $SER$ denotes the standard deviation of $\\hat{u}_i$ and includes a degrees of freedom correction (degrees of freedom in this case denotes how many variables your have used and typically is denoted with $k$. The $SER$ is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\nSER = s_{\\hat{u}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-k-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\hat{u}^2_i},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $k$ is the number of variables (including the constant) use in the regression model. Note that in the univariate regression model $k=2$---the slope coefficient and the constant.\n2. The root mean square error (RMSE) which denotes as well the sdandard deviation of $\\hat{u}_i$ but now without degrees of freedom. We have seen this before in Eq. \\ref{eq:rmse} and does not change. \n3. The R$^2$ which measures the fraction of variance of $Y$ explained by the independent variables. Again, we have seen this one before\n4. The adjusted \"adjusted R$^2$\" (or $\\bar{\\text{R}}^2$) which is equal to the R$^2$ with a degrees-of-freedom correction that adjusts for estimation uncertainty. It can be formulated as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\bar{\\text{R}}^2 = 1 - \\frac{n-1}{n-k-1}\\frac{SSR}{TSS}.\n\\end{equation}\nNote that using this formulation, in a multivariate setting, it always should hold that $\\bar{\\text{R}}^2 <\\text{R}^2$. But why do we care so much for the amount of variables that we use (denoted with $k$). That is because with each additional variable the R$^2$ always increases. And it is essential to notice that when $k=n$, the R$^2 = 1$, so there is no variation left anymore. But that feels like cheating. You just have a parameter for each observation that you have, but such a model must be meaningless. Therefore, you always want to correct for the number of variables that you use. \n\nIn our Californian school district example that would amount to the following two outcomes. First for the univariate model: \n\\begin{eqnarray}\nTestScore &= &698.9- 2.28  STR \\\\\n&&R^2 = .05, SER = 18.6\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nAnd then for the multivariate model.\n\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nTestScore &=& 686.0 - 1.10  STR - 0.65 PctEL \\\\\n&&R^2=.426, \\bar{R}^2=0.424, SER = 14.5\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nNote that all measures of fit increase. The $\\bar{\\text{R}}^2$ now indicates that 42% of all variation in test scores are explained. That is a *huge* improvement compared to the 5% explanatory power of the univariate case. That indicates that the $PctEL$ strongly correlates with testscores. But again, we are not so much interested in prediction, but want to find the causal impact of class size instead. Another thing to notice here is that the R$^2$ and the $\\bar{\\text{R}}^2$ are very close. That is because the number of variables is much smaller than the number of observations $k \\ll n$, so that the impact of $k$ is not very big.\n\nA final remark concerns a peculiarity of `STATA`. In the regression output of above, `STATA` does not provide the $\\bar{\\text{R}}^2$. That is because of the option `, robust`. Without that option, the regression output would give both measures of fit. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nreg testscr str el_pct\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      Source |       SS           df       MS      Number of obs   =       420\n-------------+----------------------------------   F(2, 417)       =    155.01\n       Model |  64864.3011         2  32432.1506   Prob > F        =    0.0000\n    Residual |  87245.2925       417  209.221325   R-squared       =    0.4264\n-------------+----------------------------------   Adj R-squared   =    0.4237\n       Total |  152109.594       419  363.030056   Root MSE        =    14.464\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     testscr | Coefficient  Std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n         str |  -1.101296   .3802783    -2.90   0.004    -1.848797   -.3537945\n      el_pct |  -.6497768   .0393425   -16.52   0.000    -.7271112   -.5724423\n       _cons |   686.0322   7.411312    92.57   0.000     671.4641    700.6004\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnother option is to specifically ask `STATA` to display the $\\bar{\\text{R}}^2$ by invoking the command `display`, then some text (text always goes between strings), and finally the thing you want to see (`e(r2_a)`).

How do we then know whether our estimation $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is unbiased? For that we again resort to our least squares assumption, some of them will change a bit and we have to add a fourth one:\n\n1.  The first least squares assumptions changes slightly. Now, we state that the conditional distribution of $u$ given all $X_i$'s has mean zero, that is, $E(u|X_1 = x_1,\\ldots, X_k = x_k) = 0$. So, $\\beta_1$ is biased even another variable $X_k$ is correlated with $u$. So, only of the variables $X_i$ has to be correlated with $u$ and then all parameters are to a certain extent biased. \n2.  The second least squares assumption is more or less as before but now in a multivariate fashion, so the whole set of ($X_{1i},\\ldots,X_{ki},Y_i$), with $i =1,\\ldots,n$, should be independent and identical distributed ($i.i.d$).\n3.  The third least squares assumptions states again that large outliers are rare for all variables included, so for all $X_1,\\ldots, X_k$, and $Y$.\n4.  The fourth assumption is new and states that there is no perfect multicollinearity. We discuss this further below. \n\n#### Multicollinearity\n\nMulticollinearity comes in two flavours; perfect and imperfect. The former functions as a multivariate least squares assumptions whilst the latter oftentimes gives the largest problems. We start the discussion with perfect multicollinearity and then continue with the case of imperfect multicollinearity. \n\n##### Perfect multicollinearity\n\nThe official definition of perfect multicollinearity is that there is a **perfect linear combination** amongst your variables. That means that there is not one optimal solution, but instead many (actually, infinitely many) more. Let us illustrate this by the following example. Suppose you include $STR$ twice in your regression. Now, `STATA` produces then the following output:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nreg testscr str str el_pct, robust\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nnote: str omitted because of collinearity.\n\nLinear regression                               Number of obs     =        420\n                                                F(2, 417)         =     223.82\n                                                Prob > F          =     0.0000\n                                                R-squared         =     0.4264\n                                                Root MSE          =     14.464\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             |               Robust\n     testscr | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n         str |  -1.101296   .4328472    -2.54   0.011     -1.95213   -.2504616\n         str |          0  (omitted)\n      el_pct |  -.6497768   .0310318   -20.94   0.000     -.710775   -.5887786\n       _cons |   686.0322   8.728224    78.60   0.000     668.8754     703.189\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSee that `STATA` drops one of the $STR$ variables. But why is that? See that the impact of twice this variable should be equivalent to:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta_1 STR = w_1 \\beta_1 STR + w_2 \\beta_1 STR = (w_1 + w_2) \\beta_1 STR , \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $w_1$ and $w_2$ are weights chosen such that they satisfy the condition that $w_1 + w_2 = 1$. But there is an infinite number of combinations that satisfy this condition! So, there is not an optimal solution and one of these variables should be dropped. \n\nThe violation of no perfect multicollearity often occurs when using dummies (see again @sec-dummy). Suppose that we regress $TestScore$ on a constant, $D$, and $B$, where:$D_i =1$ if $STR \\leq 20$, $=0$ otherwise ; $B_i =1$ if $STR>20$, $= 0$ otherwise. This example is slightly more complex as there is no perfect correlation between $B$ and $D$. However, the model contains as well a constant and that create a perfect linear combination, namely $B_i + D_i = 1$ and that is the definition of a constant ($\\beta_1 \\times 1$), so there is perfect multicollinearity in the model. \n\nA different way of seeing this is to consider the following regression model and note that by definition $D_i = 1- B_i$:\n\n\\begin{align}\nTestscr_i &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 D_i + \\beta_2 B_i + u_i\\\\\n          &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 D_i + \\beta_2 (1 - D_i) + u_i\\\\\n          &= (\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) + (\\beta_1 - \\beta_2) D_i + u_i.\n\\end{align}\nSuppose that the true constant equals $680$ and the slope parameter equals $7$. Then it is not difficult to see that there is an **infinite** amount of combinations possible of values for $\\beta_0, \\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ that leads to these numbers.\n\nNow, this example is a special case of the so-called dummy variable trap. Suppose you have a set of multiple binary (dummy) variables, which are mutually exclusive and exhaustive---that is, there are multiple categories and every observation falls in one and only one category (e.g., infant, child, teenager, adult). If you include all these dummy variables and a constant, you will have perfect multicollinearity---the dummy variable trap.\n \nThere are possible solutions to the dummy variable trap:\n\n1. Omit one of the groups (e.g., the infants), or\n2. Omit the intercept\n\nIn most cases you omit one of the groups (typically the one with the lowest value). This give the constant then the interpretation of the average value of that left-out category, where the dummy variables are then the relative differences to that left-out category. \n\nNow, perfect multicollinearity usually reflects a mistake in the definitions of the regressors, or an oddity in the data. And, usually this is not a problem, because if you have perfect multicollinearity, your statistical software will let you know---either by crashing or giving an error message or by \"dropping\" one of the variables arbitrarily and very often the solution to perfect multicollinearity is to modify your list of regressors such that you no longer have perfect multicollinearity.\n\n##### Imperfect multicollinearity\n\nImperfect and perfect multicollinearity are quite different despite the similarity of the names. Imperfect multicollinearity, namely, occurs when two or more regressors are very highly correlated. And if two regressors are very highly correlated, then their scatterplot will pretty much look like a straight line---they are collinear---but unless the correlation is exactly $\\pm$ 1, that collinearity is imperfect. What this implies is that one or more of the regression coefficients will be imprecisely estimated. Why is that? That is because of the definition of the coefficient in a multivariate regression model. Namely, the coefficient on $X_1$ is the effect of $X_1$ **holding $X_2$ constant**, but if $X_1$ and $X_2$ are highly correlated, then there is very little variation in $X_1$ once $X_2$ is held constant. That means that the data are pretty much uninformative about what happens when $X_1$ changes but $X_2$ doesn't, so the variance of the OLS estimator of the coefficient on $X_1$ will be large. And this results in large standard errors for one or more of the OLS coefficients. But often this is very hard to detect. Are standard errors high because of imperfect multicollinearity, because the number of observations is very low, or because there is large variation in the data? The answer to this unfortunately boils down to reasoning, but before you start estimating your statistical models it always good to look at scatterplots and correlations between variables. \n\nBut what is a high correlation? With a reasonable amount of observations all correlations below $0.9$ can be considered fine. In practice, only correlations between variables higher than say $0.95$ start to impose problems. \n\n### Testing with multivariate regression models\n\n#### Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for a single coefficient in multiple regression\n\nRecall from @sec-unitesting that for hypothesis testing in a classical statistical framework we make use of the fact that $\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_1- E(\\hat{\\beta}_1)}{\\sqrt{var(\\hat{\\beta}_1)}}$ is approximately distributed as $N(0,1)$ according to the Central Limit theorem. Thus hypotheses on $\\beta_1$ can be tested using the usual $t$-statistic, and confidence intervals are constructed as $\\{\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\pm 1.96 SE (\\hat{\\beta}_1)\\}$. And this finding carries over to the multivariate setting where for $\\beta_2,\\ldots, \\beta_k$ we make use of the same framework. One thing to keep in mind is that $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2$ are generally not independently distributed---so neither are their $t$-statistics (more on this later).\n\nNow, if we return to our Californian school district data set then we find that for the univariate case holds:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nTestScore =\\underbrace{698.9}_{10.4} - \\underbrace{2.28}_{0.52}  STR, \n\\end{equation}\n\nAnd the population regression \"line\" for the multivariate case is estimated as:\n\\begin{equation}\nTestScore = \\underbrace{686.0}_{8.7} - \\underbrace{1.10}_{0.43} STR - \\underbrace{0.650}_{0.031} PctEL\n\\label{eq:testmulti}\n\\end{equation}\n\nRemember, the coefficient on $STR$ in Eq. \\ref{eq:testmulti} is the effect on $TestScores$ of a unit change in $STR$, holding constant the percentage of English Learners in the district. The corresponding 95\\% confidence interval for coefficient on $STR$ in (2) is $\\{-1.10 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.43\\} = (-1.95,-0.26)$. And the $t$-statistic testing $\\beta_{STR} = 0$ is $t = -1.10/0.43 = -2.54$, so we reject the null-hypothesis at the 5\\% significance level. More evidence for the strength of the $PctEL$ variable can be seen from the fact that, under the null-hypothesis of $\\beta_2 = 0$, the following must hold: $t\\text{-statistic} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1}}{\\sigma_{\\hat{\\beta_1}}} = \\frac{0.65}{0.03} = 21.7$, which is a very high number for a $t$-statistic.\n\n#### Tests of joint hypotheses\n\nSo, testing of single coefficients is just as before. Now in the Californian school district dataset there is as well a variable called $Expn$ denoting the expenditures per pupil. Consider the following population\nregression model:\n\\begin{equation}\nTestScore_i = \\beta0 + \\beta_1 STR_i + \\beta_2 Expn_i + \\beta_3PctEL_i + u_i\n\\end{equation}\nThe null hypothesis that \"school resources don't matter\" and the alternative that they do, corresponds to: \n\n- $H_0:\\beta_1 =0$ and $\\beta_2 =0$ vs\n- $H_1:$ either $\\beta_1 \\neq 0$ or $\\beta_2 \\neq 0$ or both\n\nThis is a joint hypothesis specifying a value for two or more coefficients. That is, it imposes a restriction on two or more coefficients. In general, a joint hypothesis will involve $q$ restrictions. In the example above, $q = 2$, and the two restrictions are $\\beta_1 = 0$ and $\\beta_2 = 0$. A \"common sense\" idea is to reject if either of the individual $t$-statistics exceeds 1.96 in absolute value. But this \"one at a time\" test isn't valid: the resulting test rejects too often under the null hypothesis (more than 5%)! That is because the $t$-statistics themselves are often not independent. Instead, we need a $F$-statistic, which tests all parts of a joint hypothesis at once. Unfortunately, these types of formulas can become quickly rather complex. Consider the $F$-test for the special case of the joint hypothesis $\\beta_1 = \\beta_{1,0}$ and $\\beta_2 = \\beta_{2,0}$ in a regression with two regressors:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nF = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{t_1^2 + t_2^2 - 2\\hat{\\rho}_{t_1,t_2}t_1 t_2}{1-\\hat{\\rho}^2_{t_1 t_2}}  \\right)\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\rho}_{t_1,t_2}$ estimates the correlation between $t_1$ and $t_2$. Reject when $F$ is large (typically to be determined from large statistical tables). The $F$-statistic is large when $t_1$ and/or $t_2$ is large and the $F$-statistic corrects (in just the right way) for the correlation between $t_1$ and $t_2$. The formula for more than two $\\beta$'s is nasty unless you use matrix algebra. There is a nice large-sample ($n>50$) approximate distribution, which is the tail probability of the $\\chi^2_q /q$ distribution beyond the $F$-statistic actually computed. \n\nNow, `STATA` does this in a much easier way by invoking the `test` command **right** after the regression. So, for example, we want to test the joint hypothesis that the population coefficients on $STR$ and expenditures per pupil ($expn$) are both zero, against the alternative that at least one of the population coefficients is nonzero.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nreg testscr str expn_stu el_pct, r \ntest str expn_stu\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear regression                               Number of obs     =        420\n                                                F(3, 416)         =     147.20\n                                                Prob > F          =     0.0000\n                                                R-squared         =     0.4366\n                                                Root MSE          =     14.353\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             |               Robust\n     testscr | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n         str |  -.2863992   .4820728    -0.59   0.553    -1.234002     .661203\n    expn_stu |   .0038679   .0015807     2.45   0.015     .0007607    .0069751\n      el_pct |  -.6560227   .0317844   -20.64   0.000    -.7185008   -.5935446\n       _cons |   649.5779   15.45834    42.02   0.000     619.1917    679.9641\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n ( 1)  str = 0\n ( 2)  expn_stu = 0\n\n       F(  2,   416) =    5.43\n            Prob > F =    0.0047\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe output shows an $F$-statistic with $q=2$ restrictions with outcome 5.43. Do not directly interpret this number, but know that $\\text{Prob} > F = 0.0047$ gives the probability that under the null-hypothesis this outcome is produced. So the joint null-hypothesis that both types of expenditures are zero (at the same time), can be rejected at a 5% (and a 1%) significance level. Other types of joint tests can easily be constructed as well. For example, when you want to know whether both coefficient add up to 1, then you would state `test str + expn_stu = 1`. The final point to make is the $F$-test in the regression output itself. Here, that is for example `F(3, 416) = 147.20`. This is a joint test that all variables, except the constant, have no impact. So, $\\beta_i = 0$ for all $i$ at the **same time**. It not often that you come across a general regression $F$-test that does not reject the null-hypothesis. It namely implies that your independent variables do not contain any information about the dependent variable. \n\nAnd with the $F$-test, we now have discussed all regression outcome components displayed by `STATA`. Most of this information you do not need for your report but we will come back later to this. \n\n## Non-linear specifications {#sec-nonlinear}\n\nThe model we are using is coined the *linear* regression model, and, indeed, one of the underlying assumptions is that the relations between the independent and dependent variables are linear. Consider the relation again between test scores and class sizes in the Californian school district data. Using the following code (note now the `twoway` command that 'binds' a scatter plot with a population regression line): \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\ngraph twoway (lfit testscr str) (scatter testscr str)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWhich provides the following `STATA` output.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A linear relation](./figures/scatterlfit.png){#fig-scatterlfitcaschool fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIndeed, there might be evidence that the relation depicted in @fig-scatterlfitcaschool---if anything---is linear. But, clearly that is not the case for the relation between test scores and average district income. Namely, the syntax below:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\ngraph twoway (lfit testscr avginc) (scatter testscr avginc)\n```\n:::\n\n\nprovides the following `STATA` output.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A non-linear relation](./figures/scatterincome.png){#fig-scatterincome fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-scatterincome shows a non-linear relation, where the effect of income tapers off (note the similarity with @fig-marginalutility)---or, there is a marginal decreasing effect of average district income with respect to average school test scores. Thus, in affluent neighborhood test scores are higher, but increasingly less so. Of course, you can still try to estimate this with a linear population regression line as in @fig-scatterincome, but this introduces a well a **bias**. The estimate does not capture that what you want. Namely, it now holds that $E(u \\mid X = x) \\neq 0$, because for small $X$, say $X<10$, the residuals are negative, for medium sized $X$s most residuals are positive and for large $X>40$ all residuals are negative again. So, there is a clear relation between $X$ and $u$ and they fail to be independent. This particular form of bias is coined **specification bias**. There is another issue here and that is that the effect on $Y$ of a change in $X$ depends on the value of $X$---that is, the *marginal* effect of $X$ is not constant. Again, remember in a regression context the marginal effect is denoted by the **slope** of the population regression line.  \n\nTo remedy possible specification bias, we will use nonlinear regression population regression **functions** of $X$, or we estimate a regression function that is nonlinear in $X$. Here, it is important to see that we do so by *transforming* $X$, so the population regression 'line'. The estimator still remains a linear regression model. \n\nWe will analyse below two complementary and often adopted approaches:\n\n1.  Using **polynomials** to transform $X$. That means that the effect is approximated by a quadratic, cubic, or higher-degree polynomial. This approach as well governs to an extent so-called interaction effects which is a special case, where we multiply two different variables. \n2.  Using **logarithmic** transformations of $X$, where $Y$ and/or $X$ is transformed by taking its logarithm. Here, the main focus is on the interpretation of the $\\hat{\\beta}$s, as they change from a unit increase interpretation to a percentages interpretation which often can be found useful. \n\n### Polynomials\n\nOur first approach to non-linear specification is applying polynomials of the variables that we suspect has a non-linear impact. If that is the independent variable $X$, the we can construct the following *linear regression* model by using polynomials:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X^2_i + \\ldots + \\beta_r X_i^r + u_i\n\\label{eq:poly}\n\\end{equation}\nNote again that this is just the linear regression model---except that the regressors are powers of $X$! So, in effect we transform the data---actually create new variables $X^r$---, but the specification in parameters remains linear. Estimation, hypothesis testing, etc. proceeds as in the multiple regression model using OLS. However, the coefficients are now a bit more difficult to interpret. Consider the example of above about the relation between test scores average district income, where $Income_i$ is defined as the average district income in the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ district (thousands of dollars per capita). For a quadratic specification, we specify the linear regression model as below:\n\\begin{equation}\nTestScore_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Income_i + \\beta_2 (Income_i)^2 + u_i\n\\end{equation}\nFor a cubic specification the linear regression model becomes:\n\\begin{equation}\nTestScore_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 Income_i + \\beta_2 (Income_i)^2 +\n\\beta_3 (Income_i)^3 + u_i\n\\end{equation}\n\nFirst, we focus on the estimation of the quadratic function. In `STATA` this would look like:\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nreg testscr c.avginc##c.avginc, r\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear regression                               Number of obs     =        420\n                                                F(2, 417)         =     428.52\n                                                Prob > F          =     0.0000\n                                                R-squared         =     0.5562\n                                                Root MSE          =     12.724\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                  |               Robust\n          testscr | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n           avginc |   3.850995   .2680941    14.36   0.000      3.32401    4.377979\n                  |\nc.avginc#c.avginc |  -.0423085   .0047803    -8.85   0.000     -.051705   -.0329119\n                  |\n            _cons |   607.3017   2.901754   209.29   0.000     601.5978    613.0056\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, it is straightforward to test the null-hypothesis of linearity against the alternative that the regression function is a quadratic. Namely, we only have to consider the $t$-statistic of the quadratic term. And that is larger than 1.96, so against a 5% significance level we reject the null-hypothesis of linearity. \n\nNote by the way the syntax `c.avginc##c.avginc` which seems a bit strange. However, this particular line of code is very useful for later tabulation, plotting and other manipulations of the output. In this way `STATA` knows that there should be a quadratic effect of the same variable (`avginc`). The syntax `c.` denotes that the variable should be considered as continuous instead of as an integer (try using without `c.` and behold the horrible output). There are four useful operators that you want to know when working with polynomials and interaction effects:\n\n- `i.` operator: this specifies that the following variable is an integer and should be considered on all its level. This actually create indicator or dummies variables\n- `c.` operator: this specifies that the following variable is a continuous variables and should be treated as continuous.\n- `#` binary operator that specifies an interaction between two variables\n- `##` binary operator that specifies both the interaction effect between two variables and the individual variable effects\n\nPlotting of non-linear population regression lines is a bit tricky. Namely, you want to combine a polynomial with a linear dimension. One way of doing this is as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\npredict hat1 \nscatter (testscr avginc) || (line hat1 avginc, sort)\n```\n:::\n\n\nwhere after the regression we **predict** the test scores (and name it something like `hat1`) and then we ask for a line of the prediction for each value of average district income. Note, though, that we have to `sort` the prediction from small to large to get a smooth line. And this provides the nice curved population regression line in the following `STATA` output.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A non-linear relation](./figures/scatterqua.png){#fig-scatterqua fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBut what is now the marginal effect of average district income. That, now, depends on itself. Namely, $\\frac{\\partial \\text{testscore}}{\\partial \\text{income}} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 \\text{income}$. Another way of seeing this is to compute the effects for different values of $X$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{TestScore_i} = 607.3 + 3.85 Income_i - 0.0423(Income_i)^2\n\\end{equation}\nThe predicted change in test scores for a change in income from \\$5,000 per capita to \\$6,000 per capita then amounts to:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\Delta \\widehat{TestScore} &=& 607.3 + 3.85 \\times 6 -  0.0423 \\times 6^2 \\notag \\\\\n&& - (607.3 + 3.85\\times 5 - 0.0423\\times 5^2) \\notag \\\\\n&=&3.4\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nAnd if we calculate the predicted effects for different values of $X$, then we get the following table:\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-effectqua .cell tbl-cap='Effect of X'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Change in Income (1000 dollar per capita) |$\\Delta \\widehat{TestScore}$ |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:----------------------------|\n|from 5 to 6                               |3.4                          |\n|from 25 to 26                             |1.7                          |\n|from 45 to 46                             |0.0                          |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThus, the effect of a change in income is greater at low than high income levels (perhaps, a declining marginal benefit of an increase in school budgets?). But, be careful here! What is the effect of a change from 65 to 66? That is negative and already @ref(fig-scatterqua) shows that a quadratic specification starts to decline after the value of about 50; and perhaps that is not the behavior that you want. So, with polynomials it is essential not to extrapolate outside the range of the data (and still interpret the outcome).\n\nThe estimation of a cubic specification is straightforward:\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nreg testscr c.avginc##c.avginc##c.avginc, r\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear regression                               Number of obs     =        420\n                                                F(3, 416)         =     270.18\n                                                Prob > F          =     0.0000\n                                                R-squared         =     0.5584\n                                                Root MSE          =     12.707\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           |               Robust\n                   testscr | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n---------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n                    avginc |   5.018677   .7073504     7.10   0.000      3.62825    6.409103\n                           |\n         c.avginc#c.avginc |  -.0958052   .0289537    -3.31   0.001     -.152719   -.0388913\n                           |\nc.avginc#c.avginc#c.avginc |   .0006855   .0003471     1.98   0.049     3.26e-06    .0013677\n                           |\n                     _cons |    600.079   5.102062   117.61   0.000     590.0499     610.108\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhere if we now want to test the null-hypothesis of linearity, then we have to invoke an $F$-test.

Namely, instead of multiply a variable with itself $X\\times X = X^2$, you now multiple a variable with another variable. And you want to do this to take into account interactions between independent variables. Assume, for example, that a class size reduction is more effective in some circumstances than in others (which is quite conceivable). Perhaps smaller classes help more if there are many English learners (i.e., large migrant communities), who need more individual attention. That is, $\\frac{\\partial TestScore}{\\partial STR}$ might depend on $PctEL$. More generally, this subsection looks into the fact that the marginal effect of $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X_1}$ might depend on some other variable $X_2$.\n\n#### Interactions between two binary variables\n\nFirst, we look into the simplest (and perhaps most insightful) case of two binary (dummy) variables. Consider therefore the following linear regression model:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i =\\beta_0 +\\beta_1 D_{1i} + \\beta_2 D_{2i} +u_i, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere both $D_{1i}$ and $D_{2i}$ are now considered to be binary. Now, of course, $\\beta_1$ is the effect of changing $D_1=0$ to $D_1=1$. So, in this specification, this effect doesn't depend on the value of $D_2$. To allow the effect of changing $D_1$ to depend on $D_2$, we have to include the interaction term $D_{1i} \\times D_{2i}$ as a regressor:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i =\\beta_0 +\\beta_1 D_{1i} + \\beta_2 D_{2i} + \\beta_3 (D_{1i} \\times D_{2i}) + u_i\n\\end{equation}\n\nTo interpret now the coefficient $\\beta_1$ we compare the two cases; for $D_1=0$ and for to $D_1=1$:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nE(Y_i|D_{1i}=0, D_{2i}=d_2) &=& \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 d_2 \\\\\nE(Y_i|D_{1i}=1, D_{2i}=d_2) &=& \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 d_2 + \\beta_3 d_2 \n\\end{eqnarray}\nIf we now subtract them from each other:\n\\begin{equation}\nE(Y_i|D_{1i}=1, D_{2i}=d_2) - E(Y_i|D_{1i}=0, D_{2i}=d_2) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 d_2\n\\end{equation}\nthen we have the marginal effect of $D_1$ which now depends on $d_2$. The interpretation of $\\beta_3$ boils down to being incremental to the effect of $D_1$, when $D_2 = 1$\n\nLet us go back to our Californian school district example with the following variables to be used: test scores, student teacher ratio, and English learners. Let:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nHiSTR &=& 1 \\text{ if } STR \\geq 20 \\text{ and } HiEL = 1 \\text{ if }\nPctEL \\geq 10 \\\\\nHiSTR &=& 0 \\text{ if } STR < 20 \\text{ and } HiEL = 0 \\text{ if }\nPctEL < 10 \\\\\n\\end{eqnarray}\nAnd if we have the estimation results we get the following outcome. \n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{TestScore} = 664.1 - 18.2 HiEL - 1.9 HiSTR - 3.5(HiSTR \\times\nHiEL)\n\\end{equation}\nSo, how to interpret the various parameters? Perhaps the simple way is to construct the following two-by-two table:\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-intdummies .cell tbl-cap='Interpretation of interaction effects with dummies'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|            |$HiEL = 0$            |$HiEL = 1$                        |\n|:-----------|:---------------------|:---------------------------------|\n|$HiSTR = 0$ |$664.1$               |$664.1 - 18.2 = 645.9$            |\n|$HiSTR = 1$ |$664.1 - 1.9 = 662.2$ |$664.1 - 1.9 - 18.2 - 3.5= 640.5$ |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, @tbl-intdummies specifies for each combination (and there are exactly four of them) of $HiSTR$ and $HiEL$ the average expected test score outcome. Clearly, there are different 'marginal' effects of $HiSTR$. Namely, the effect of $HiSTR$ when $HiEL = 0$ is $-1.9$, whilst the effect of $HiSTR$ when $HiEL = 1$ is $-1.9 - 3.5 = -5.4$. This points out that a class size reduction is estimated to have a bigger effect when the percent of English learners is large. However, when you estimate this in `STATA` then you see that this interaction is not statistically significant, because the $t$-statistic equals $3.5/3.1 = 1.1$\n\n#### Interactions between continuous and binary variables\n\nThe second case we consider is between a continuous and a binary variable. First assume the following regression model:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i =\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 D_i + +u_i, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $D_i$ is a binary variable and $X$ is a continuous variable. As specified above, the effect on $Y$ of $X$ (holding $D$ constant) = $\\beta_1$, which does not depend on $D$. To allow the effect of $X$ to depend on $D$, we can include the interaction term $D_i \\times X_i$ as a regressor:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i =\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 D_i  + \\beta_3 (D_i \\times X_i) + u_i\n\\end{equation}\n\nWhat this binary-continuous interaction does is essential create two different population regression lines. Namely, for observations with $D_i= 0$ (the $D = 0$ group or the $D=0$ regression line) there is:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i  + u_i,\n\\end{equation}\nWhilst for observations with $D_i= 1$ (the $D = 1$ group or the $D = 1$ regression line) the regression line comes down to:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nY_i &=&   \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_3 X_i + u_i \\\\\n\t\t\t&=&  (\\beta_0 + \\beta_2) + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) X_i + u_i\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\nAnd these two population regression lines might both differ in the level (the constant) and in the slope of the line. So, there are three possibilities as depicted in @fig-interaction:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Three possible binary-continuous interaction outcomes](./figures/Sheet44.jpg){#fig-interaction fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the first panel (a), $\\beta_3 = 0$, so there is only a level effect. In the second panel (b), both $\\beta_2$ and $\\beta_3$ are not 0, so there is both a level and a slope effect. The last panel indicates that $\\beta_2 = 0$, meaning that there is only a slope effect. But how to interpreting the coefficients now? Therefore, we take the marginal effect of\n\\begin{equation}\nY =\\beta_0  + \\beta_1 X  +\\beta_2 D+ \\beta_3 (D \\times X)\n\\end{equation}\nwhich yields:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 D\n\\end{equation}\nThus, the effect of $X$ depends on $D$ and $\\beta_3$ is the increment to the effect of $X$, when $D = 1$ (a slope effect).\n\nTo see this in our Californian school district example we now use the variables test scores, student teacher ratio and the as previously defined dummy variable $HiEL$ as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{TestScore} = 682.2 - 0.97 STR + 5.6 HiEL - 1.28(STR \\times HiEL) \n\\end{equation}\nNow when $HiEL = 0$ the population regression line amounts to:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{TestScore} = 682.2 - 0.97 STR \n\\end{equation}\nAnd when $HiEL = 1$ the population regression line is:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\widehat{TestScore} &=& 682.2 - 0.97 STR + 5.6 - 1.28 STR \\\\\n&=& 687.8 - 2.25 STR\n\\end{eqnarray}\nThus we have two regression lines: one for each $HiSTR$ group. And the conclusion is that a class size reduction is estimated to have a larger effect when the percent of English learners (migrant communities) is large.\n\nHypothesis testing is as before. To test whether the two regression lines have the same slope, the null-hypothesis boils down to the coefficient of $STR \\times HiEL$ being zero: the $t$-statistic of this one become $-1.28/0.97 = -1.32$ and thus we do not reject this test. To test whether the two regression lines have the same intercept, the null-hypothesis becomes the coefficient of $HiEL$ being zero, yielding: $t = -5.6/19.5 = 0.29$, so we do not reject that null-hypothesis either. Interestingly, the null-hypothesis that the two regression lines are the same---population coefficient on $HiEL = 0$ and population coefficient on yields $STR \\times HiEL = 0$: $F = 89.94 (p-value < .001)$. So, we reject the joint hypothesis but neither individual hypothesis.\n\nFinally, the question may arise how to draw such lines as in @fig-interaction.

Then we regress testscores on class size, the new `hiel` dummy variable and the interaction using the two hashtags. We then ask for the marginal effect of `hiel`, so for both values of it (being 0 and 1), for all class sizes between 14 and 26 (with steps of 2). Finally, we ask for the plots of the margins using the command `marginsplot`. This provides the following `STATA` plot.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Predicted population regression lines of districts with large and small percentage english learners](./figures/interactionplot.png){#fig-interactionplot fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nClearly, @fig-interactionplot shows that districts with more English learners (containing larger migrant communities) have lower test scores overall. Above that, class size seems to have a larger negative effect on districts with more English learners as the slope is more negative.  \n\n#### Interactions between two continuous variables\n\nThe last case are interactions between two continuous variables and that is always a difficult case of interpret. Starting again with the model:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i =\\beta_0 + \\beta1 X_{1i} +\\beta_2 {X_{2i}} +u_i,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere both $X_1$, $X_2$ are continuous and as specified, the effect of $X_1$ doesn't depend on $X_2$ and the effect of $X_2$ doesn't depend on $X_1$. Now, to allow the effect of $X_1$ to depend on $X_2$, we include the interaction term $X_{1i} \\times X_{2i}$ as a regressor. Where, to interpret the coefficients, we take the first derivative of $X_1$ in:\n\\begin{equation}\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{1i} + \\beta_2 X_{2i} + \\beta_3 (X_{1i}\n\\times X_{2i}) + u_i\n\\end{equation}\nwhich yields:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X_1} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 X_2\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\beta_3$ should be interpreted as the increment to the effect of $X_1$ from a unit change in $X_2$. \n\n### Logarithmic transformations\n\nTo incorporate non-linear effects, very often logarithmic transformations are used of $Y$ and/or $X$, where we use $\\ln(X)$, being the natural logarithm of $X$. One feature of logarithmic transformations is that they permit modeling relations in percentage terms (like elasticities), rather than linearly. That is because:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ln(x+\\Delta x) - \\ln(x) = \\ln (1 + \\frac{\\Delta x}{x}) \\cong \\frac{\\Delta x}{x}\n\\end{equation}\nNote that this is an approximation, but from calculus we know that $\\frac{d \\ln(x)}{dx}=\\frac{1}{x})$. And the above approximation works quite well for small numbers. For example, numerically: $\\ln(1.01) = .00995 \\cong .01$ and $\\ln(1.10) = .0953 \\cong .10$, where the latter is still rather close. Now remember the following rules for natural logarithms:\n\n1. $\\ln(a\\times b)= \\ln(a)+\\ln(b)$\n2. $\\ln(\\frac{a}{b}) =\\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$\n3. $\\ln(a^\\alpha) = \\alpha \\ln(a)$\n4. $\\ln(e^X) = X$.\n\nWhen you encounter a nonlinear model a strategy that often works is log-linearization. This works as follows for, e.g., the following Cobb-Douglas specification:\n\\begin{equation}\nY = A K^\\alpha L^{1-\\alpha} \\rightarrow \\ln(Y) = \\ln(A) + \\alpha \\ln(K) + (1-\\alpha) \\ln(L).\n\\end{equation}\nThus, you take the natural logarithm on both sides. There are three different cases of logarithmic regression models as specified in @tbl-logspecifications.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-logspecifications .cell tbl-cap='Three cases of logarithmic specifications'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Three logarithmic transformation\n\n|Case       |Population regression model                 |\n|:----------|:-------------------------------------------|\n|linear-log |$Y_i=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln(X_i) + u_i$      |\n|log-linear |$\\ln(Y_i)=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (X_i) + u_i$    |\n|log-log    |$\\ln(Y_i)=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln(X_i) + u_i$ |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThough statistical testing remains the same, the interpretation of the slope coefficient differs in each case. To derive the interpretation we want to find the marginal effect of $X$ using the first derivative. Let's do that for the three cases above.\n\n#### Linear-log population regression model\n\nThe linear-log population regression model is specified as:\t\n\\begin{equation}\n\tY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln(X)\n\\end{equation}\nNow take the first derivative of $Y$ to $X$:\n\t\\begin{equation}\n\t\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X} = \\frac{\\beta_1}{X} \n\\end{equation}\nso \n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\beta_1  = \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X / X} \n\\end{equation}\nIn this case that means that $\\beta_1$ should be interpreted as the absolute change of $Y$ when $X$ changes with $\\beta_1/100$ percent. To illustrate this, consider the case where we take the natural logarithm of district income, so we define the new regressor as, $\\ln(Income)$.\n\nThe model is now linear in $\\ln(Income)$, so the linear-log model can be estimated by OLS, which yields\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\t\\widehat{TestScore} = 557.8 + 36.42\\times \\ln(Income_i)\n\\end{equation}\nso an 1\\% increase in $Income$ is associated with an increase in test scores of 0.36 points on the test. And again, standard errors, confidence intervals, $R^2$---all the usual tools of regression apply here. But the difficulty in plottin the new regression line remains. Consider the following `STATA` syntax, where we first have to define the new regressor by invoking the `generate` command. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\ngen lninc = ln(avginc)\nreg testscr lninc, r\npredict testhat\ngraph twoway (line testhat avginc, sort) (scatter testscr avginc)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThis now provides the following `STATA` output.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A non-linear relation](./figures/scatterlnincome.png){#fig-scatterlnincome fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWhen you compare @fig-scatterlnincome with @fig-scatterqua then you notice that in the case of logarithm the population remains increasing (but less and less steep). This can be considered as an advantage when you want to estimate decreasing (or increasing) returns. \n\n#### Log-linear population regression model\n\nThe second case we consider is the log-linear population regression model, as specified by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\ln(Y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\n\\end{equation}\nTo find the interpretation of $\\beta_1$, we again take the first derivative $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X}$, but first transform the model like this:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tY = exp( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X )\n\\end{equation}\nthen take the first derivative:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X} = \\beta_1  exp( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X ) = \\beta_1 Y\n\\end{equation}\nand collect terms\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\beta_1  = \\frac{\\partial Y / Y}{\\partial X } \n\\end{equation}\n\nThe interpretation of $\\beta_1$ now is that one unit change in $X$ causes a $\\beta_1$ percentage in $Y$\n\n#### Log-log population regression model\n\nFinally, we have our third case, being the log-log population regression model as specified by:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\ln(Y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln(X)\n\\end{equation}\n\nTo find the interpretation of $\\beta_1$, we again take the first derivative $\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X}$, but first transform the model like this:\n\\begin{equation}\n\tY = exp( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln(X) )\n\\end{equation}\nSo\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial X} = \\beta_1 /X  exp( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln(X) ) = \\beta_1 Y /X\n\\end{equation}\nand after collecting terms we end up with an **elasticity**:\n\\begin{equation}\n\t\\beta_1  = \\frac{\\partial Y / Y}{\\partial X / X } \n\\end{equation}\n\nAs an example consider the case when we want to regress ln(test scores) on ln(income). To do so, we first define a new dependent variable, ln(TestScore), and a new regressor, ln(Income)\nThe model is now a linear regression of ln(TestScore) against ln(Income), which can be estimated by OLS as follows\n\\begin{equation}\n\\widehat{ln(TestScore)} = 6.336 + 0.0554 \\times ln(Income_i),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the interpretation is that an 1\\% increase in $Income$ is associated with an increase of .0554\\% in $TestScore$ ($Income$ goes up by 1\\%, $TestScore$ goes up by 0.06\\%).\n\nSuppose that we now want to plot both the log-linear and the log-log specification, then we can use the following syntax:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\ngen lninc = ln(avginc)\ngen lntestscr = ln(testscr)\nreg lntestscr lninc, r\npredict testhat1\nreg lntestscr avginc, r\npredict testhat2\ngraph twoway (line testhat1 avginc, sort) (line testhat2 avginc, sort) (scatter lntestscr avginc), legend(order(1 \"log-log specification\" 2 \"log-linear specification\" 3 \"Observations\")) \n```\n:::\n\n\nwhich provides the following `STATA` output.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![A non-linear relation](./figures/scattercompare.png){#fig-scattercompare fig-align='center' width=600px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the $y$-axis is on a logarithmic scale here, thus the log-linear specification is now a linear line. \n\n#### Summary: logarithmic transformations\n\nWe have seen three different cases of logarithmic specification, differing in whether $Y$ and/or $X$ is transformed by taking logarithms. Now, the regression is linear in the new variable(s) $\\ln(Y)$ and/or $\\ln(X)$, and the coefficients can be estimated by OLS where hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are now implemented and interpreted 'as usual'. Only the interpretation of the coefficients differs from case to case and is directly related to percentage changes (growth) and elasticities. Oftentimes, the choice of specification, however, should be guided by judgment (which interpretation makes the most sense in your application?), tests, and plotting predicted values. Sometimes, though, you have a structural economic model such as Eq. \\ref{eq:directutility}, which defines the type of specification you should use. Finally, see that in economics many models exists with decreasing or increasing return to scale and that these are very closely related with logarithmic specifications. \n\n## Using fixed effects in panel data {#sec-fixedeffects}\n\nMultivariate regression is a powerful tool for controlling for the effect of variables for which we have data. But often we do not have data on what we suspect might be important---such as individual characteristics like ambition, intelligence, drive or stamina. Or regional of country data, where the type of soil, the ruggedness (hilliness), or population density determine to a large extent the behavior of people living on it. If we do not have this type of data, then it is not always the case that everything is lost. Especially, when we have repeated observations, so observations on the same entity throughout time. This is referred to as panel data and requires one additional subscript $t$ as in $X_{it}$ indicating the observation $X$ on individual $i$ made at time $t$. To understand why this sometimes works, we temporarily change to another dataset and that is the 'fatality' data collected by @levitt2001dangerous which deals with the relation between drunk driving and fatal accidents in the States of the US between 1982 and 1988. For this particular example we look at the impact of the 'beer tax', measured as the real tax in dollars on a case of beer, on 'fatality', measured as the number of annual traffic deaths per 10,000 people in the population of each state. For this we first read the data and manipulate the mortality variable\n\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nuse \"./data/fatality.dta\", clear\ngen fatality = allmort/pop * 10000\n```\n:::\n\n\nand then run a simple regression:\n\n\n::: {.cell collectcode='true'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n. regress fatality beertax, robust\n\nLinear regression                               Number of obs     =        336\n                                                F(1, 334)         =      47.59\n                                                Prob > F          =     0.0000\n                                                R-squared         =     0.0934\n                                                Root MSE          =     .54374\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             |               Robust\n    fatality | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n     beertax |   .3646054   .0528524     6.90   0.000     .2606399     .468571\n       _cons |   1.853308   .0471297    39.32   0.000     1.760599    1.946016\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBut these outcomes are very strange. For every dollar increase in tax, number of fatal accidents per 10,000 people increases with 0.36, which is statistically significantly different from 0. What is going on here. Most likely this effect is biased because of omitted variable bias. States in the US differ widely in terms of population density, environment, institutions, religion, poverty, and so on and so forth. And those state characteristics might influence both the variables beertax and fatality. \n\nFortunately, for each state we have yearly data. In fact for each state we have 7 observations. And we can make use of that by using so-called fixed effects, which is a very common technique in the social sciences---especially in economics. We model the use of fixed effects in this example as follows:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{fatality}_{it} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{beertax}_{it} + \\beta_3 S_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_51 S_{48} + u_{it}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $S_i$ denote indicator (dummies) for each state which constitute the fixed effects. In total there are 48 states in this dataset, so we have 48 dummies. Note that these fixed effects only depend on variation over states, not over years. So, essentially what these fixed effects capture is all state **specific** characteristics which are **constant** over time. And most of the characteristics' examples given above do not vary that much over time, so by using these state fixed effects we can **control** for them. In `STATA` you can estimate this in a straightforward way as `regress fatality beertax i.state, robust`, but this creates lots of statistical output that you are usually not interested in. Almost just as easy would be is to invoke the `areg` command, where you specifically state that the state variable should be used as dummies but not shown using `absorb(state)`: and then run a simple regression:\n\n\n::: {.cell max-width='1400px'}\n\n```{.stata .cell-code}\nareg fatality beertax, absorb(state) robust\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear regression, absorbing indicators             Number of obs     =    336\nAbsorbed variable: state                            No. of categories =     48\n                                                    F(1, 287)         =  10.41\n                                                    Prob > F          = 0.0014\n                                                    R-squared         = 0.9050\n                                                    Adj R-squared     = 0.8891\n                                                    Root MSE          = 0.1899\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             |               Robust\n    fatality | Coefficient  std. err.      t    P>|t|     [95% conf. interval]\n-------------+----------------------------------------------------------------\n     beertax |  -.6558737   .2032797    -3.23   0.001    -1.055982   -.2557655\n       _cons |   2.377075   .1051516    22.61   0.000     2.170109    2.584041\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, see what happens with the coefficient of the beer tax variable. It changes sign! So from positive it becomes negative. That is how **disruptive** omitted variable bias can be. Also see that by including all these state fixed effects, the $\\bar{\\text{R}^2}$ now increase enormously to 91%, which does make sense because the states explain the variation in fatality rate to a large extent (e.g., compare Kansas with Connecticut).\n\nThis is just a snapshot of the use of fixed effects in panel data, but for now this is enough. The main message you should take home with it that the use of fixed effects can go a long way in addressing omitted variable bias. \n\n## Conclusion and discussion\n\nThis chapter dealt with multivariate regression analysis in which I argue that from an applied econometrics perspective the main reason to control for additional variables is to control for omitted variable bias. In the social sciences, this bias is almost always an issue. That is because in the socio-economic domain most phenomena are correlated with each other. Humans make decisions and base their behavior on decisions and behavior of other humans creating many forms of feedback loops. \n\nNow, this is not to say that we need to include every variable that we have data on. This is only to say that we have think *a priori* about our selection of control variables, preferably in some kind of causal framework. \n\nMoreover, this chapter dealt as well with non-linear transformations of variables, so that more realistic specification can ben estimated. Especially, in economics with its many forms of decreasing (sometimes increasing) returns to scale, it is important to account for concave (the slope keeps positive but gets smaller and smaller) relations. \n\nFinally, I dealt very shortly with the use of fixed effects---in this case still a set of additional dummies to account for omitted variable bias. Fixed effects are *very* often used in economics. Every empirical paper addresses them and in more advanced courses more time and attention will be spent on them. \n\n\n",
